# Documenting Clinical project work

### Project Over view 

This project analyzes patient diagnosis data to identify disease patterns across demographics. It examines the most common diseases, gender and age-based prevalence, and the impact of insurance coverage. By comparing new, old, and recurring cases, the project provides insights into healthcare trends. The findings support public health decisions, hospital resource planning, and policy evaluation.

### Data Sources

Clinical Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "clinical_data.csv" file, containing detail information about patient diagnosis.

### Tools Used

- Excel - Data cleanining
- SQL Server - Data Analysis 
- Tableau - Visualization/ Report

### Data Cleaning/ Preparation 

In the initial preparation phase, I perform the folowing tasks;
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Removing all duplicate
3. Handling missing values
4. Data formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involve the exploring clinical data to answer key questions, such as;

- Which diseases are more frequent in males and females?
- What is the proportion of new, old, and recurring cases?
- Do certain diseases occur more in specific age groups?
- What are the most common diagnoses among patients?
